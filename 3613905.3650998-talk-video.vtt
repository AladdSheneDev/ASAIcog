Hello everyone! I am presenting our paper “Embracing Embodied Social Cognition in AI: Moving Away from

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.960
Computational Theory of Mind.”

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:18.720
Social cognition enables us to understand and interact with others and ourselves; in the context of AI, this translates to the development of systems that can not only

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.560
process information but also understand and adapt to the social context of their interactions with humans.

00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:31.000
The integration of social cognition into AI draws from seminal works. Newell’s “Bands of Cognition”

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.800
presents a multi-layered cognitive framework emphasizing that social cognition is complex

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.200
and formulated over time. Minsky’s “Society of Mind” and Brooks’ Subsumption Architecture suggest that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.200
complex social understanding in AI could emerge from the collaboration of specialized agents or

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.280
through interaction-focused behaviors. These foundational theories collectively underline

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.323
the complexity of embedding social cognition 
in AI.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:03.800
The prevalent computational approach to incorporating social cognition in AI is based on the Theory of Mind (ToM). According to ToM,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.760
an individual can make inferences about others’ mental states in a social situation by

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.360
observation and act accordingly. Over the years, various approaches have been developed to create

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.019
developed to create AI systems with artificial ToM.

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:28.320
However, ToM has limitations. It views the mind as isolated, inferring others’ states solely through observation and neglecting the dynamic,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.615
interactive nature of social cognition. Crucially, it overlooks the importance of social physical embodiment in these processes.

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:42.520
We propose an alternative, focusing on embodied socio-cognitive theories, especially

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.280
Participatory Sensemaking (PSM). PSM emphasizes the emergence of new understanding and sensemaking

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.560
through interaction, something individual cognition cannot achieve alone. Similarly,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.840
Observable Creative Sensemaking (OCSM) provides measurable, observable parameters—participation, newness, and appropriateness—

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.276
that can guide AI in responding to the nuances of social interactions.

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:13.560
Let us look at a speculative case study of text-to-image AI like Midjourney that can utilize social cognition via OCSM

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.680
to enhance functionality, divided into three phases: First, in Prompt Understanding, Midjourney applies

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.080
OCSM to assess ‘Newness’ and ‘Appropriateness’ in user prompts to grasp creative goals.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.120
Next, it analyzes these aspects during Adaptive Image Generation and converses with users to tailor

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.280
outputs to their changing creative visions. Finally, the Interactive Feedback Loop continuously updates

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.080
its comprehension based on user feedback, offering diverse image options. This iterative, communicative

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.368
process fosters better sensemaking and enriches the co-creative experience.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:55.600
